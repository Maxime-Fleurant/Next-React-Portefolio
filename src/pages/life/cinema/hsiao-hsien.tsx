              The Time to Live and the Time to Die, also known as A Time to
              Live, A Time to Die is a 1985 film directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien.
              This film is inspired by screenwriter-turned-director Hou's own
              coming-of-age story. This film is the second part of Hou's
              coming-of-age trilogy, preceded by A Summer at Grandpa's (1984)
              and followed by Dust in the Wind (1986).

              Spanning the years 1947–65, the film follows the maturation of
              Ah-ha (Ah-hsiao) as he and his family (parents, grandmother, older
              sister, three brothers) cope with the shock of leaving their
              homeland (the grandmother keeps talking about returning to the
              mainland to visit the ancestors). Having been only a child during
              the move, Ah-ha quickly acclimatizes himself to the new country,
              often putting him at odds with his more traditional family; he
              joins a street gang and has to choose between that life and taking
              the college entrance exam.

              The film's title is a reference to a character in a manga called
              Crest of the Royal Family who is hailed as Daughter of the Nile.
              The film is a study of the life of young people in contemporary
              Taipei urban life, focusing on the marginalised figure of a woman
              and centred on a fast-food server's hapless crush on a gigolo. The
              introductory sequence of the film suggests a parallel between the
              difficulties faced by people in the film (Taiwan's urban youth,
              transitioning from a classical civilization into a changing world)
              and the mythic struggles of characters in the Egyptian Book of the
              Dead. It features Taiwan pop singer Lin Yang, Jack Kao (Kao Jai)
              as her brother, and Tianlu Li in the role of the grandfather. Li
              became a central part of Hou's major films, and Kao starred in
              several of them.

              Lin Hsiao-yang (Lin Yang), tries to keep her family together while
              working as a waitress at Kentucky Fried Chicken and going to night
              school. Her mother and older brother are dead. Her father (Fu
              Sheng Tsui) works out of town. It is up to Lin Hsiao-yang to take
              care of her pre-teen sister, who has already begun to steal, and a
              brother (Jack Kao) who is a burglar and gang member.

              gambling den with his friend Hsi (Hsi Hsiang). He takes his
              acolyte Flatty (Lim Giong) and Pretzel (Annie Shizuka Inoh),
              Flatty's girlfriend, who works part-time in a night club. Gao's
              girlfriend Ying (Hsu Kuei-Ying) works in the same night club as
              Pretzel and doesn't like the people around Gao, finding them
              dangerous. Gao has already made a deal with Hsi to invest in a
              nightclub in Shanghai, but Ying doesn't want him to go. Instead,
              she wants him to stay in Taiwan to open a restaurant. A succession
              of get-rich-quick schemes leads them to the brink of disaster.
              Throughout the course of the film the unsavory alliance between
              the underworld and the political elite emerges.

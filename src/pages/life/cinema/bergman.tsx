              Summer with Monika (Swedish: Sommaren med Monika) is a 1953
              Swedish film directed by Ingmar Bergman, based on Per Anders
              Fogelström's 1951 novel of the same title. It was controversial
              abroad at the time of its first release for its frank depiction of
              nudity and, along with the film One Summer of Happiness from the
              year before, directed by Arne Mattsson, it helped to create the
              reputation of Sweden as a sexually liberated country. The film
              made a star of its lead actress, Harriet Andersson. Bergman had
              been intimately involved with Andersson at the time and conceived
              the film as a vehicle for her. The two of them would continue to
              work together, even after their romantic relationship had ended,
              in films like Sawdust and Tinsel, Smiles of a Summer Night,
              Through a Glass Darkly, and Cries and Whispers.

              <br />
              The film's story begins in the bleak working-class milieu of
              Stockholm. Harry (Lars Ekborg) and Monika (Harriet Andersson) are
              both in dead end jobs when they meet. Harry is easygoing, while
              Monika is adventurous, but they fall in love. When Monika gets in
              trouble at home, Harry steals his father's boat, and he and Monika
              spend an idyllic summer in the Stockholm archipelago. When the end
              of the summer forces them to return home, it is clear that Monika
              is pregnant. Harry happily accepts responsibility and settles down
              with Monika and their child; he gets a real job and goes to night
              school to provide for his family. Monika, however, is unsatisfied
              with her role as homemaker. She yearns for excitement and
              adventure, a desire which finally leads her astray. Harry leaves
              town for work and comes home a day early to find his wife with
              another man. They get a divorce and Harry is left behind with
              custody of their daughter, June, to raise alone.

              Wild Strawberries is a 1957 Swedish drama film written and
              directed by Ingmar Bergman. The original Swedish title is
              Smultronstället, which literally means "the wild strawberry patch"
              but idiomatically signifies an underrated gem of a place, often
              with personal or sentimental value. The cast includes Victor
              Sjöström in his final screen performance as an old man recalling
              his past, as well as Bergman regulars Bibi Andersson, Ingrid
              Thulin, and Gunnar Björnstrand. Max von Sydow also appears in a
              small role. Bergman wrote the screenplay while hospitalized.
              Exploring philosophical themes such as introspection and human
              existence, Wild Strawberries received positive domestic reception
              upon release, and won the Golden Bear for Best Film at the 8th
              Berlin International Film Festival. It is often considered to be
              one of Bergman's greatest and most moving films and one of the
              greatest films ever made.

              The Virgin Spring (Swedish: Jungfrukällan) is a 1960 Swedish rape
              and revenge film directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in medieval
              Sweden, it is a tale about a father's merciless response to the
              rape and murder of his young daughter. The story was adapted by
              screenwriter Ulla Isaksson from a 13th-century Swedish ballad,
              "Töres döttrar i Wänge" ("Töre's daughters in Vänge"). Bergman
              researched the legend of Per Töre with an eye to an adaptation,
              considering an opera before deciding on a film version. Given
              criticism of the historical accuracy of his 1957 film The Seventh
              Seal, he also invited Isaksson to write the screenplay. Other
              influences included the 1950 Japanese film Rashomon. Max von Sydow
              played Töre.
              <br />
              <br />
              Isaksson and Bergman explored a number of themes in The Virgin
              Spring, questioning morals, vengeance, and religious beliefs. The
              rape scene was also subject to censorship in screenings in the
              United States.

              Through a Glass Darkly (Swedish: Såsom i en spegel, lit. 'As in a
              Mirror') is a 1961 Swedish drama film written and directed by
              Ingmar Bergman, and starring Harriet Andersson, Gunnar
              Björnstrand, Max von Sydow and Lars Passgård. The film tells the
              story of a schizophrenic young woman (Andersson) vacationing with
              her family on a remote island, during which time she experiences
              delusions about meeting God, who ultimately appears to her in the
              form of a monstrous spider. Meanwhile, her author father attempts
              to use her illness in his work, and her brother struggles with
              sexual frustration.
              <br />
              <br />
              Bergman structured the film as a three-act play, drawing on his
              personal experiences and relationships. The film was his first of
              several shot on the island of Fårö, at the recommendation of
              cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The score incorporates the music of
              Johann Sebastian Bach. Themes explored include the equation of God
              with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality.

              Persona is a 1966 Swedish psychological drama film, written and
              directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Bibi Andersson and Liv
              Ullmann. The story revolves around a young nurse named Alma
              (Andersson) and her patient, well-known stage actress Elisabet
              Vogler (Ullmann), who has suddenly stopped speaking. They move to
              a cottage, where Alma cares for Elisabet, confides in her and
              begins having trouble distinguishing herself from her patient.

              Characterized by elements of psychological horror, Persona has
              been the subject of much critical analysis, interpretation and
              debate. The film's exploration of duality, insanity and personal
              identity has been interpreted as reflecting the Jungian theory of
              persona and dealing with issues related to filmmaking, vampire
              mythology, lesbianism, motherhood, abortion and other subjects.
              The experimental style of its prologue and storytelling has also
              been noted. The enigmatic film has been called the Mount Everest
              of cinematic analysis; according to film historian Peter Cowie,
              "Everything one says about Persona may be contradicted; the
              opposite will also be true".

              Cries and Whispers (Swedish: Viskningar och rop, lit. 'Whispers
              and Cries') is a 1972 Swedish period drama film written and
              directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Harriet Andersson, Kari
              Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann. The film, set in a mansion
              at the end of the 19th century, is about three sisters and a
              servant who struggle with the terminal cancer of one of the
              sisters (Andersson). The servant (Sylwan) is close to her, while
              the other two sisters (Ullmann and Thulin) confront their
              emotional distance from each other.

              <br />
              Inspired by Bergman's mother, Karin Åkerblom, and his vision of
              four women in a red room, Cries and Whispers was filmed at
              Taxinge-Näsby Castle in 1971. Its themes include faith, the female
              psyche and the search for meaning in suffering, and academics have
              found Biblical allusions. Unlike previous Bergman films, it uses
              saturated colour, crimson in particular.

            Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in
            different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to
            test.
            <br />
            <br />
            Centralizing your application's state and logic enables powerful
            capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and much more.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Redux DevTools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how
            your application's state changed. Redux's architecture lets you log
            changes, use "time-travel debugging", and even send complete error
            reports to a server.
            <br />

                Redux Toolkit is written in TypeScript, and its API is designed
                to enable great integration with TypeScript applications.

                Using configureStore should not need any additional typings. You
                might, however, want to extract the RootState type and the
                Dispatch type.

                Container Pattern is commonly used to separate data
                fetching/logic, events, and state from presentational components
                (aka, dumb components).
                <br />
                <br />
                This can be particularly helpful if you want to reuse your
                presentational components in other use-cases, in your current
                project/codebase or in other projects. Keeping your components
                ‚Äúdumb‚Äù makes it much easier to share and reuse them.

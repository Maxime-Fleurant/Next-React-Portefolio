            DataLoader is a generic utility to be used as part of your
            application's data fetching layer to provide a simplified and
            consistent API over various remote data sources such as databases or
            web services via batching and caching.
            <br />
            <br />A port of the "Loader" API originally developed by @schrockn
            at Facebook in 2010 as a simplifying force to coalesce the sundry
            key-value store back-end APIs which existed at the time. At
            Facebook, "Loader" became one of the implementation details of the
            "Ent" framework, a privacy-aware data entity loading and caching
            layer within web server product code. This ultimately became the
            underpinning for Facebook's GraphQL server implementation and type
            definitions.
            <br />
            <br /> DataLoader is a simplified version of this original idea
            implemented in JavaScript for Node.js services. DataLoader is often
            used when implementing a graphql-js service, though it is also
            broadly useful in other situations. <br />
